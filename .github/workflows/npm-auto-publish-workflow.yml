# This Github Action is designed to automatically publish NPM packages.
#
# While this Github Action will often be triggered, it will only publish a new package
# if the version specified in the package.json file(s) is behind that already published.
#
# Further documentation on how this webhook works can be found at the following URL:
# https://github.com/marketplace/actions/npm-publish
